# Hey, I'm Antoine 👋

**Founder @ [Syncta.ai](https://syncta.ai) · Full-Stack Developer · AI Automation**

I build full-stack web applications and AI automation systems for businesses. Based in California — originally from France.

## What I do

As the founder of Syncta.ai, I help companies ship production-grade applications fast — combining React, TypeScript, and Supabase with AI-assisted development workflows. My clients include consulting firms, SaaS startups, and enterprises.

**Recent work includes:**
- A payroll management system with multi-level approval workflows, Google OAuth, and automated notifications
- A social media SaaS platform enabling scheduling and publishing across 6 platforms with Stripe subscriptions
- AI lead automation workflows achieving 94% qualification success rates in under 30 seconds
- Custom n8n + OpenAI pipelines saving enterprise clients 20+ hours per week

Before Syncta, I ran ALB Interactive for 3 years — a web agency delivering websites and mobile applications for businesses across France.
